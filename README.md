One of the main causes of climate change is the emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from transportation and energy consumption. This not only leads to catastrophic impacts on human health, wildlife, and ecosystems but also contributes to air pollution and environmental degradation.
To address this issue, we are inspired to create a user-friendly and professional application called Ecominder.

EcoMinder allows users to input their vehicle data and determine their carbon footprint impact. Furthermore, the application will provide suggestions on how people can reduce their carbon footprint, thereby empowering users to take tangible steps towards promoting sustainability.
By using Ecominder, users will be able to track their carbon footprint and take proactive steps towards reducing it. Additionally, promoting clean energy and transportation not only benefits the environment but also creates new job opportunities, strengthens the economy, improves human, wildlife, and ecosystem health.
